                    <h3>Theory of Relativity</h3>
                    <p>Albert Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space, time, gravity, and the universe. Special relativity (1905) explained that the laws of physics are the same for all observers, regardless of their motion. General relativity (1915) introduced gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. </p>

                    <h3>Big Bang Theory</h3>
                    <p>This theory explains the origin of the universe from a very hot, dense state and its subsequent expansion. Evidence for the Big Bang includes the cosmic microwave background radiation, the abundance of light elements in the universe, and the redshift of distant galaxies. </p>

                    <h3>DNA Double Helix</h3>
                    <p>James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the structure of DNA, the molecule that carries genetic information. This discovery revolutionized our understanding of genetics and has led to numerous advances in medicine, biotechnology, and agriculture. </p>

                    <h3>Plate Tectonics</h3>
                    <p>This theory explains the movement of Earth's continents and the formation of mountains, volcanoes, and earthquakes. It proposes that Earth's surface is made up of several rigid plates that float on a hot, molten mantle. The movement of these plates causes them to collide, diverge, and slide past each other.</p>

                    <h3>Gravitational Waves Detection</h3>
                    <p>The LIGO Scientific Collaboration announced the first direct detection of gravitational waves, ripples in space-time caused by violent cosmic events, such as merging black holes. This observation confirmed a major prediction of Einstein's general relativity and opened a new way of observing the universe.
